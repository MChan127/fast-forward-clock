Fast Forward Clock
==================

This is my first Android app coded entirely in Java, and meant to be an exploration into Android programming/revisiting of the Java language. It's a very simple application featuring a digital clock that can be sped up at a rate of 1.25x, 1.5x or 2x depending on user settings. Additional features are planned for the future to make the app less bland, but for now it's very much work-in-progress.

The objective is experimental/education, but the app may prove beneficial for those seeking to enhance their own productivity by means of coercion from a more rapidly progressing day.
